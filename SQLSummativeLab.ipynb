    "In part 1 of this assessment, you will complete several requested SQL queries in order to extract data, analyze, and provide insights from a single provided SQL database. You will also visualize the key results of 3 of these queries. There are also several 'Reflection' questions that ask you to write out a text based answer in the provided markdown cell. Following the guided question and answer section, in part 2 you will explore a second dataset on your own using SQL in order to conduct a preliminary analysis. You will be asked to produce a very short slide presentation highlighting the work you did for this second section.\n",

    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Interpret \"word problems\" and translate them into SQL queries\n",
    "- Decide and perform whichever type of JOIN is best for retrieving desired data\n",
    "- Use GROUP BY statements to apply aggregate functions like COUNT, MAX, MIN, and SUM\n",
    "- Use the HAVING clause to compare different aggregates\n",
    "- Write subqueries to decompose complex queries\n",
    "- Visualize data using matplotlib, seaborn, or pandas\n",
    "- Choose the correct chart type based on the given data\n"

    "- Runtime\n",

    "Initial Exploration:\n",
    "- Use SQL in combination with Pandas to explore the database\n",
    "- Identify interesting trends, patterns, or relationships in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Question Formulation:\n",
    "- Develop at least one substantial business question for deeper analysis\n",
    "- Ensure the question is relevant, specific, and can be addressed with the available data\n",

    "Data Cleaning Assessment:\n",
    "- Identify potential data cleaning tasks necessary for your deeper analysis\n",
    "- Note: You are not required to perform the cleaning, only to recognize and list the necessary tasks\n",

    "Null Value Handling:\n",
    "- Be aware that the dataset contains null values in certain fields\n",

    "### Deliverables:\n",

    "    - This can and should include things like data normalization/standardization and null handling\n",

    "Tips for Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin with broad exploratory queries to understand the data's scope and content. Then focus on honing in on interesting relationships between different data categories. Consider industry trends, audience preferences, or financial aspects when formulating your business question. Pay attention to data quality issues, inconsistencies, or limitations that might affect your analysis. Remember, the goal is to demonstrate your analytical thinking and ability to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets. Good luck with your exploration!\n",
